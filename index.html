    <p class="text-center"><h3> Sewing has a very ancient history: it is estimated to begin during the Paleolithic Age. 
    It was used to stitch together animal skin for clothing and shelter. The Inuit used tendons from caribous for thread and bones of animals as needles; 
    the American indigenous people used sewing to make tents. In Africa, to create baskets,like the ones made by Zulu weavers, who used thin strips of palm leaf as "thread", sewing was combined with the weaving of plant leaves.
    The weaving of cloth from natural fibres originated in the Middle East around 4000 BCE, and perhaps earlier during the Neolithic Age.</h3>
